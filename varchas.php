 		<p>Moreover, being the educated core of the country, the students of IIT Jodhpur try to fulfil their social duties through "Soch -The Social Aspect of Varchas". Soch is a platform where we take up pertinent social issues and try to find possible solutions through discussions and debates; spread awareness and conduct drives to involve people spanning across varied backgrounds. We attempt to create a profound social impact for the amelioration of the society.</p>
