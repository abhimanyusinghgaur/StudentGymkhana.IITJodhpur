		<blockquote><b>“ The will to win is important, but the will to prepare is vital. ”</b></blockquote>
        <p>Sports are known for producing the most remarkable athletes, colourful characters, influential leaders and memorable heroes. IIT Jodhpur Sports Society reflects the same spirit of introducing sporting activities to the campus community. This society aims to promote sports and exercise in the true spirit of sportsmanship and motivate students to work with team spirit. We strive and endeavour to inculcate and introduce this essential activity as a part of the daily decorum in every student’s life. We at IITJ believe in bringing out and encouraging the sports person in each one of you under the guidance of professional coaches and with best sporting facility.</p>
		<blockquote><b>“ The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. ”</b></blockquote>
		<p>Individuals can be strong on their own but they are much stronger in a team. Victory achieved alone can be sweet but there is nothing sweeter than sharing that moment with your team. One of the rare times in life one learns to play with his friends and some of his enemies and yet respect each one of them for the innate respect of the sport. That is the essence of introducing sports in a student’s life to instil the quality of vigour, pride, sacrifice and strive.</p>

		<h5>Captain's Message</h5>
		<h6><b>Athletics</b></h6>
		<p>We athlete run, run until we defeat ourselves, run until our muscles tear and run until the track cannot bear our footsteps. We run with pride and glory, until we can't run anymore but still we run because we are athletes of IIT Jodhpur.</p>
		<h6><b>Badminton</b></h6>
		<p>"I was written off by many as someone having mediocre talent. I faced a lot of challenges while looking for someone to coach me. I was rejected by many who thought I was lacking in talent. I am thankful to Almighty that he gave me parents who are my pillars of support and have struggled a lot to give me the life I am leading today."</p>
		<p>This was the answer of Saina Nehwal when asked about her early life struggle while pursuing badminton. So the question is, what turned an ordinary talent into world no 1. Again her answer was simple, "Hard work and practice". So why can’t we, that's the belief in our badminton team. At last I just want to say "PRACTICE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER WON, PERFORM LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER LOST".</p>
		<h6><b>Basketball</b></h6>
		<p>Basketball is our life, rest all is distraction. We believe, ‘A basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist” and that’s how we play. Where each member is sure of himself and his contribution to praise the skills of mates, a team. Being in basketball team of IITJ will not only build your character, it'll also reveal it.</p>
		<h6><b>Cricket</b></h6>
		<p>"Cricket is the religion of our country and Sachin the God of this religion". The team's success is not determined by one batsman or a bowler but by all the 11 players who make this team. After all we know "Talent wins games but teamwork and intelligence wins championships."</p>
		<h6><b>Football</b></h6>
		<p>Good, better, best. We never let it rest until our good is better and our better is best. IITJ FC - kicking balls since 2009.</p>
		<h6><b>Lawn Tennis</b></h6>
		<p>Love the game for being involved in a team whose members can't wait to see you do your best. Tennis is our passion, our only love. The Tennis Family!</p>
		<h6><b>Squash</b></h6>
		<p>It never gets easier you just get better. To uncover your true potential you must first find your own limits and then you have to have the courage to blow past them. So rise above your limits and beat the best of you. It’s not whether you get knocked down; it’s whether you get up. SQUASH is not just a game, it's the spirit of passion. Pain is temporary here but pride is forever. Relish the training you had, honor your commitment and cherish the results.</p>
		<h6><b>Table Tennis</b></h6>
		<p>Love the game for being involved in a team whose members can't wait to see you do your best. Tennis is our passion, our only love. The Tennis Family!</p>
		<h6><b>Volleyball</b></h6>
		<p>Volleyball is a complex game of simple skills, a sport where wins are determined by a team's aerial power. We jump the highest, hit the hardest, and are in continuous motion, mentally as well as physically. We are individual players united by volleyball!</p>
		<h6><b>Weightlifting</b></h6>
		<p>"It will hurt, it will take time, it require dedication, willpower, it require to   make healthy decisions, there will be temptation, we will push ourselves to max, but at the end when we reach our goal lift we are worth it"</p>
