Ignus - the creative flame, the bonfire of euphoria,the glow of triumph, Ignus. the inter college socio-techno-cultural fiesta of IIT Jodhpur began in 2011 with the brand name Taksh, later re-christened to Ingus. It is a festival that celebrate humanity, for it is a unique conjugation of technology(triumph of human mind), culture (triumph of human soul) and social drive(triumph of human spirit).

Encapsulation within it the enjoyment and exuberance of exhilarating Rock Shows, liberation classical performances, modish fashion shoes, brain-storming quizzes, a plethora of in-formals and nonstop DJ dance floors. There's also lot more of technical events and workshops ranging from programming,web-designing robotics, electronics, automobiles to aero-modelling to look out for.

It provides a great platform for the technocrats to innovate, design and present their ideas as wall as to the singers, dancers, actors, artists and writers to showcase their talents.

Cheers!
